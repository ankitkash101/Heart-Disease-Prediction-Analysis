# Conclusion 💡
-From target value we can say that our dataset is amost balanced with 54% of patients having heart disease and 46 % of patients not having heart disease.

-Females have higher chances of having heart disease than females.

- Patients with age >55 years and having resting blood suger( i.e in diastolic state) in range 121-140 mm Hg have higher chances of heart disease. patients with age group 40 to 45 have little chances and age below 40 has negligiable cgances of having a heart disease.

-Patients suffering from heart disease are mostly in age group of 55-65 years.

-Higher cholesterol means higher chances of heart disease. it plays an important role in determining heart problems. With age cholesterol increases and level 200- 350 mg/dl are of concern.

- Patients showing symmetric T wave in Resting electrocardiographic measurement are more likely to suffer from a heart disease.

-Patients who are likely to suffer from heart disease have higher maximum heart rates( rate between 140-160) whereas patients who are not likely to suffer from heart disease are having lower maximum heart rates.

- Exercise induced anginal pain slightly lower chances of getting heart disease than without exercise induced pain.

-ST depression mostly increases between the age group of 30 40.
